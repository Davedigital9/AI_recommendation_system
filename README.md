# AI_recommendation_system
This is a model code demonstrating the ability to train AI models to recommend options or actions based on our most re-occurring choices. This model uses data from "Amazon Reviews data (http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/) The repository has several datasets. For this case study, we are using the Electronics dataset."
Now while this takes the form of an e-commerce bot, this tech nology can be implemented in several sectors like in Music - recommend sound settings and effects for a group of singers based on the voices in the group or how talented they are.
